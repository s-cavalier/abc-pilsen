## Lesson Plan
This is the general sketch of what's to come, but is subject to change based on how well recieved certain topics are.

| Date | Lesson |
| ---- | ------ |
| 6/22 | First sketches and making the skeleton of our website! |
| ... | Experimentation until the kids feel comfortable with basic HTML. |

| ... | If they get the hang of it quick, maybe some JS to finish the session! |
